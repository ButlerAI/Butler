 * A collection of alarms for a light. The protocol allows for 256 different
 * alarms but the current firmware (1.5) only supports 2 alarms. 
 * See {@link LFXAlarmCollection#size()} for the number of alarms supported. 
 * Note that the light gives a reference to its alarm collection before the 
 * collection is guaranteed to be loaded so if {@link LFXAlarmCollection#size()} 
 * is 0 it may still be loading.
 * 
 * The alarm collection is only loaded once when the light is discovered. 
 * To update the alarms call {@link LFXAlarmCollection#load()}.
